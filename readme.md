# __Crafting Efficiency__
Adds technologies to increase the productivity of some recipes  

## Features
- __Crafting Efficiency__:

  - Setting to bypass the 300% productivity cap ***(default off)***.
  - Allow to others mods to add/modify their own productivity with CE_Add_Recipe and CE_Insert_recipe ***(to see how to use it, please check [there](https://github.com/Grifonice99/crafting-efficiency-2/tree/main/crafting-efficiency-2/prototypes/expansions))***.


## The Story
Originaly started as [__Crafting Effiencncy Forked__](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/crafting-efficiency-forked) a porting of [__Crafting Efficiency__](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/crafting-efficiency) from factorio 0.18 in factorio 1.0 to use with my friends but with bugs and a complex codebase to start working on. 
And so i started to work on a new mod from scratch based on the same concept but with a total different implementation. and so this mod was born.

It's still not perfect and i will continue to work on it and any type of suggestion it's appreciated.
