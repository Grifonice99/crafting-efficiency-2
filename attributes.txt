To add a custom productivity you just need to use CE_Add_Recipe
Example:

data = {
        name = "Copper cable productivity",
        stages = 6,
        stages_packs = Packs,
        stages_levels = { 3, 3, 3, 4, 5 },
        stages_costs = { 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1200 },
        stages_cost_multipliers = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.5 },
        stages_productivities = { 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 },
        stages_times = { 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45 }
    }

CE_Add_Recipe(data, name)
